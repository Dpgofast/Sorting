# STRETCH: implement the Count Sort function below
# What is count sort?

"""According to Wikipedia "In computer science, counting sort is an algorithm
for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers;
that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number
of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those
counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its
running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the
maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in
situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the
number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in another sorting
algorithm, radix sort, that can handle larger keys more efficiently"."""
